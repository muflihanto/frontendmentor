## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I used the `aria-controls` attribute to establish a programmatic relationship between the accordion toggle and its content panel. This helps assistive technologies understand which part of the page is being affected by the control.

```tsx
<details
  aria-controls={`answer-${id}`}
  id={`question-${id}`}
  // ...
>
  <summary aria-expanded={open}>
    {question}
  </summary>
</details>

<div
  role="region"
  id={`answer-${id}`}
  aria-labelledby={`question-${id}`}
>
  {answer}
</div>
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - aria-controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-controls) - This helped me understand how to properly link controlling elements with their controlled regions for better accessibility.
