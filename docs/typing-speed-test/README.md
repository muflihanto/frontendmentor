## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

This project provided my first opportunity to use the `onPaste` event in React. I used it to prevent users from cheating on the typing test by pasting text directly into the hidden input field.

```tsx
<input
  // ... other props
  onPaste={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
/>
```

I also wrote a test using Playwright to ensure this functionality works correctly:

```typescript
test("prevents pasting text into the input field", async ({ page }) => {
  const input = page.locator('input[type="text"]');

  const defaultPrevented = await input.evaluate((node) => {
    // Dispatch a native paste event that bubbles up to React's event listener
    const pasteEvent = new Event("paste", {
      bubbles: true,
      cancelable: true,
    });
    node.dispatchEvent(pasteEvent);
    return pasteEvent.defaultPrevented;
  });

  // Verify the onPaste handler called e.preventDefault()
  expect(defaultPrevented).toBe(true);

  // And verify the input's value has not changed from empty as an extra safeguard
  await expect(input).toHaveValue("");
});
```
