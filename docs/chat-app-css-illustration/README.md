## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Motion library for React

### What I learned

This project marks my earliest usage of `PropsWithChildren` utility type from React. This utility type helps to properly type component props that include children.

```tsx
import { type PropsWithChildren } from "react";

function ChatGroup({
  variant,
  children,
}: PropsWithChildren<{ variant?: "left" | "right" }>) {
  return (
    <div
      className={`mb-2 flex flex-col ${variant === "right" ? "items-end self-end" : "items-start self-start"}`}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

function ChatLeft({
  children,
  className,
}: PropsWithChildren<{ className?: string }>) {
  return <div className={twMerge("...", className)}>{children}</div>;
}
```

`PropsWithChildren<P>` is a utility type that adds `children?: React.ReactNode` to the provided props type `P`, making it cleaner and more type-safe than manually defining children in every component's props interface.
