## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

To implement an accessible tooltip that appears on hover and focus, I followed the W3C ARIA Tooltip pattern. This involves using `aria-describedby` on the trigger element to link it to the tooltip, and giving the tooltip itself a `role="tooltip"`.

```tsx
<button
  aria-describedby={`tooltip-${props.day}`}
  // ... other props
/>
<p
  id={`tooltip-${props.day}`}
  role="tooltip"
>
  {`$${props.value}`}
</p>
```

### Useful resources

- [W3C ARIA Tooltip Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tooltip/) - This helped me implement an accessible tooltip for the chart bars.
