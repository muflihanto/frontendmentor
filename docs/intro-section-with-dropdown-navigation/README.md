## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

To prevent background scrolling when the mobile menu is open, I used a `useEffect` hook to toggle the `overflow` property of the `body` element.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (isMenuOpen) {
    document.body.style.overflow = "hidden";
  } else {
    document.body.style.overflow = "unset";
  }
}, [isMenuOpen]);
```

<!--### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect. -->

### Useful resources

- [MDN - overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) - This helped me understand how to control scrolling behavior.
