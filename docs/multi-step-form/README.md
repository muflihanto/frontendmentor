## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

#### URL Query Tracking

The form's progress is tracked using URL query parameters, providing browser history support and allowing users to navigate between steps using the back/forward buttons.

##### Query Parameters

- **`step`**: (1 | 2 | 3 | 4) Determines the currently active form step.
- **`completed`**: (1) When set to `1` on step 4, the "Thank You" confirmation screen is displayed instead of the summary.

##### Navigation & Validation

The application uses a combination of URL queries and Jotai state (`completedStep`) to ensure a linear flow:

1. **Initial Load**: If no `step` is present, the user is redirected to `step=1`.
2. **Step Protection**: A validation hook prevents users from manually skipping to future steps via the URL. If the requested `step` is greater than the `completedStep` stored in state, the user is redirected back to their last valid step.
3. **Step Indicators**: The sidebar navigation links are dynamically enabled or disabled based on the user's progress.
