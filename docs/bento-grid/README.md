## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

"**display: contents**" makes the container disappear, making the child elements children of the element the next level up in the DOM

Example:

- The actual code:

  ```html
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1>Recent articles</h1>
    <p>A look at my recent articles about CSS</p>
  </div>
  ```

  ```css
  .page-header {
    display: contents;
  }
  ```

  the visual:

  ```html
  <!-- <div class="page-header"> -->
  <h1>Recent articles</h1>
  <p>A look at my recent articles about CSS</p>
  <!-- </div> -->
  ```

<!-- ### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect. -->

### Useful resources

- [CSS display contents](https://ishadeed.com/article/display-contents/) - This helped me understand how to use display contents to build more fluid layouts.
