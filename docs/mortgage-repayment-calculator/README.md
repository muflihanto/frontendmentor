## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

- We can specify when the form validation done using `validator` props.

  - `onSubmit`

  ```typescript
  <form.Field
    name="amount"
    validators={{
      onSubmit: z.coerce.number().min(1, "This field is required"),
    }}
  >
  ```

  - `onChange`

  ```typescript
  <form.Field
    name="amount"
    validators={{
      onChange: z.coerce.number().min(1, "This field is required"),
    }}
  >
  ```
