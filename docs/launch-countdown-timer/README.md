## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Motion library for React

### What I learned

#### Testing

- CSS transition assertions like `toHaveCSS` auto-retry, so no `waitForTimeout` is needed after hover/unhover actions.

  ```ts
  // Before: explicit wait for transition
  await link.hover();
  await page.waitForTimeout(500);
  await expect(icon).toHaveCSS("fill", "rgb(251, 96, 135)");

  // After: auto-retries until CSS matches
  await link.hover();
  await expect(icon).toHaveCSS("fill", "rgb(251, 96, 135)");
  ```
